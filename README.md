Epistemics of the Virtual
=========================

Silicon Coppélia as we dubbed our system works from the features of the observed other, appraises these in various domains (e.g., ethics and affordances), then compares them to goals and concerns of the agent, to finally reach a response that includes intentions to work with the user as well as a level of being engaged with the user. This ultimately results in an action that adds to or changes the situation both agencies are in. 

Unlike many other systems, Silicon Coppélia can deal with ambiguous emotions of its user and has ambiguous **feelings** of its own, which makes its decisions quite human-like. Silicon Coppélia is open to scrutiny and experimentation by way of an open-source implementation in Ptolemy.

**Sophia Utility Platform** (SUP) brimming with cutting-edge robotics technology and software tools, including our famous facial expressions, gestural arms and hands, autonomous social interactions, self-navigating mobility, and a powerful Hanson-AI software suite, with tools for rapid application development, we provide Sophia's proven capabilities, both as art and with original research, now available as a robust product for the world. Now, mass-producing our most advanced versions of Sophia robots to date, with API and SDK, we have opened our Sophia character and technology to serve many kinds of research projects and uses.
